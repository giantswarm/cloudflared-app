# Cloudflared chart

Giant Swarm offers a Cloudflared App which can be installed in workload clusters.
Here we define the Cloudflared chart with its templates and default configuration.

## What is this app?
This app allows you to launch [Cloudflare Tunnels](https://www.cloudflare.com/en-gb/products/tunnel/)
and then route directly to services inside of your cluster. This approach
bypasses any external ingress paths and can also be configured to bypass
Kubernetes Ingress

## Why did we add it?
This approach makes it a lot easier for customers who might be constrained in
regards to ingress options (such as limited external load balancer services or
for security reasons). It is especially useful for clusters that are OnPrem and
not running in a Public Cloud provider, as it allows those users to route
traffic from a public interface (Cloudflare) to private services running in Kubernetes.

## Who can use it?
Anyone that has a Cloudflare account can use this App.


## Installing

There are 3 ways to install this app onto a workload cluster.

1. [Using our web interface](https://docs.giantswarm.io/ui-api/web/app-platform/#installing-an-app)
2. [Using our API](https://docs.giantswarm.io/api/#operation/createClusterAppV5)
3. Directly creating the [App custom resource](https://docs.giantswarm.io/ui-api/management-api/crd/apps.application.giantswarm.io/) on the management cluster.

(Note: It is possible to use the chart in this repository directly)

## Configuring
This app can be used in 2 ways:


1) Use existing tunnels -> This is the recommended Cloudflare way of running Cloudflared Tunnels
2) App Managed -> The App manages to create and delete the tunnels for you

### 1) Use existing Tunnels

Create Cloudflared Tunnel(s) from an existing device (It is recommended to at least create two tunnels for resilience). You can run `cloudflared` command:

```bash
$ cloudflared tunnel create <NAME>
```
It creates the tunnel and generates the credentials file in the default cloudflared directory. Also, it creates a subdomain of .cfargotunnel.com.

__Note__: You can map your (sub)domain now to the tunnel one `<TUNNEL_ID>.cfargotunnel.com.`. More info in the [official guide](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/connections/connect-apps/install-and-setup/tunnel-guide).

Once the tunnels are created, the credentials JSON file(s) can be found in `~/.cloudflared/`. These need to be saved in a Kubernetes secret:

```bash
kubectl create secret generic -n cloudflared-namespace cloudflared-credentials --from-file=credentials.json=~/.cloudflared/<TUNNEL_ID-1>.json
```

At the same time, it is required to set `useExistingTunnels.enabled` to true and complete the keys within `useExistingTunnels` (An example is presented [below](#use-existing-tunnels)).

### 2) App Managed Cloudflared Tunnels
In order to use this you will need to ensure you have the following:

- Email address to login to Cloudflare API
- Cloudflare Account ID

![Cloudflare Account ID](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/giantswarm/cloudflared-app/main/accountid.png)
- Cloudflare API token with `Account:MyAccount Tunnel:Edit` capability

![Cloudflare API Token](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/giantswarm/cloudflared-app/main/apitoken.png)

#### Optional

The Tunnel requires a secret to launch, if one is not supplied the App can
create one for you. But as this secret is essential for launching the tunnel it
must be saved securely to ensure that you can launch the tunnel elsewhere if
needed.

You can supply your own secret:

```bash
 uuidgen | base64 | kubectl create secret -n my-tunnel generic my-tunnel-secret --from-file=/dev/stdin
```

The tunnel secret needs to be 32 bytes or more and needs to be stored base64 encoded. You can later supply the Kubernetes secret name.

####⚠️ *WARNING* When using Cloudflared tunnels managed by the app, the tunnel will be deleted upon
removal of the app. A pre delete hook will be executed that cleans the tunnel connection and then deletes the tunnel.

## Compatibility

This app has been tested to work with the following workload cluster release versions:

*

## Limitations

Some apps have restrictions on how they can be deployed.
Not following these limitations will most likely result in a broken deployment.
